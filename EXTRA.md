# Invisibility Cloaking via Real-time Object Detection in Video

This extra tasks extends the _Harry Potter_ style **invisibility cloaking** to
use real-time object detection and segmentation (specifically a neural network
based technique known as **[Mask R-CNN](https://viso.ai/deep-learning/mask-r-cnn/)**.)


## Task Setup

![Start Terminal Diagram](img/XXXX.png)

Some quick steps to get you setup for object detection:

1. ....
2.  ....
3. ...
4.  ...
    * ...
    * ...
    * ...

**If all the setup steps ...** - make sure you have all the supporting materials to hand, and go to **Task 5** below.

## Task 5 - Invisibility Cloaking via Object Detection

In this extra exercise, we ....

To try this out:
- copy and paste the code from this example [XXX.py](src/XXXS.py?raw=1) into your Visual Studio Code window (replacing all earlier code) again save (File > Save)
- run the code (click _"Run > Run Without Debugging"_)
- ....
- ....

You should now see a scene where .....

### How does this work ?

This approach is using a trained object detection and segmentation model known as a [Mask Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network](https://viso.ai/deep-learning/mask-r-cnn/) ....

### Some other things to try ...

If time allows you may want to try extending this code with the following features:
- ....
- ....

## Additional Info

**Instructor Notes:** tested with [OpenCV](https://opencv.org) 4.6.x. (08/2022) on Durham University LDS (Debian Linux) + OpenSuSE Linux Tumbleweed.

**Developer Notes:** to add - additional versions with sliders controls for object confidence, perhaps.
