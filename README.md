# Colour Selection and Filtering in Real-time Video

This repository contains a set of computer science taster coding excercises for colour filtering from a live video image, including Harry Potter style invisibility cloaking. It is designed to give you a starter experience in Python coding and real-time image manipuluation. 

## Getting Started 

Four quick steps to get you started:

1. Ensure the computer is booted into Linux
2.  Login with the provided username and password
3.  Start Visual Studio Code (Menu: Applications > Programming > Visual Studio Code)
4.  Within Visual Studio Code select: File > New File
    * Click _"Selection a language"_ and choose _"Python"_
    * It will then say _"Do you want to install the recommended extensions for Python?"_
    * Click _"Install"_ and wait ~1 minute whilst everything is setup for you

**You are now ready to start coding** - make sure you have all the supporting materials to hand, and go to **Task 1**

#### Supporting Materials
